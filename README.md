# Getting Started with Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Edvora Rides Assessment

This is my first next.js project and it is given by edvora as a assessment. You have 3 rides bar - nearest rides, upcoming rides and past rides. As the name suggests, nearest rides shows you the rides sorted by their nearest values of distance from your user station code , upcoming rides shows you rides which has dates for future and past rides shows you rides which has date for the future. And in filter bar you can filter out rides which according to the states and cities.
